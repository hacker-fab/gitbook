**For a description of what the team at CMU is working on in Spring 2025, check out** [**this document**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cksUbf5onK4FIIpE_ZZxUgtdfJ7OKFyU2kt76BniGkw/edit?usp=sharing)**!**

Goals of this page:

* Not to try and cover theory or industry standard, but to break the problem into first principles just enough to give context to the quantifiable parameters
* Also an opportunity to frame the problem wide enough to set the tone of thinking of these machines from the ground up (aligned with goal, don't think of industry as immutable)
* Exhaustive list of industry methods and examples
* Quantifiable end user parameters with descriptions + standardized tests

## Background

#### Overview

A photolithography stepper is a machine that exposes a pattern of light onto a layer of photoresist chemical on the wafer, then ‚Äòsteps‚Äô over to the next pattern. Before each exposure, it must align with previous patterns on the wafer so that each layer of the device is in the correct position relative to the previous. The accuracy with which it can do this is called ‚Äúalignment accuracy‚Äù. Alignment accuracy and optical resolution are the two most important metrics of a stepper‚Äôs performance.

There are 2 main components of our stepper: the light source and optics, and then the mechanical micropositioning stage that moves the chip itself. Alignment accuracy is a function of both the mechanical micropositioning stage and the reliability of the projector‚Äôs optomechanical components.

#### Masked vs. Maskless Lithography Systems

Commercial lithography machines use photomasks to create the image, typically made of chrome on glass. Instead, our Maskless Photolithography Stepper uses a DLP projector to create a pattern. This allows us to change patterns instantly, opening the option up for advanced techniques like tiling (making a circuit larger than one exposure field).
