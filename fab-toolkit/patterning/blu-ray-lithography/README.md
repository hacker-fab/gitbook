# Blu-Ray Lithography

## Introduction

This is the project page for a lithography system based on repurposing Blu-Ray drives. The initial goal is to reach a feature size of at least 500nm (2x the Blu-ray laser spot size). As a stretch goal, we would like to also use the sled and spindle motors as high speed nano-positioners and to spin coat and cure photo-resin.

## Safety

✓ Safety goggles/glasses are absolutely necessary.\
A laser dot contains a large amount of energy in such a small space, in the form of light. Your eyes are extremely sensitive to light, and a direct exposure to this very dense energy light for less than a second will blind you for life. We can prevent this by wearing a special type of light filtering glasses, somewhat like the way sunglasses work. _But, sunglasses will not work as laser safety glasses._ These glasses need to be coated for the correct wavelength. Do not purchase any laser safety glasses under $30, buy from an authorized and reputable seller such as survival lasers. $5 lenses from China will not be sufficient, and have been proven unsafe.

Currently Recommended: [UV-blocking glasses](https://www.amazon.com/Tool-Klean-Safety-Glasses-Protection/dp/B081BHTJT8/ref=sr_1_5?crid=38LVX5C7MIN2M\&keywords=uv+protection+glasses\&qid=1674228429\&sprefix=uv+protection+%2Caps%2C96\&sr=8-5)\

✓ Be fully aware of what you are pointing at.\
With a massive amount of light comes the heat as well. Lasers higher than Class IV (>500mW) burn certain objects very easily, lower powers do burn as well but not as intensely. Lasers like this can most definitely burn furniture such as carpet and couches, hardwood floors, curtains, walls etc. You need to make sure that you are not burning anything against your desire. _If the heat build up in an object from a laser is sufficient enough,_ the object could be set on fire.\
\
✓ Keep in mind of any dangerous objects/surfaces.\
Look out for anything noticeably reflective/smooth such as a mirror, polished metal, or even something smooth like a desk. The last thing you want is a laser beam reflected back at you into your eye. Even with safety goggles/glasses, you should not take a chance. Something else dangerous that you need to look out for are flammable items, a high powered laser can easily ignite a match or alcohol. CAREFUL WITH WINDOWS - None are 100% transparent, and WILL reflect a solid beam back towards you, this goes for any type of glass at all. All reflected beams are also a danger and this is no exception. Windows are also a bad thing to be pointing a laser through, you don't know exactly where/what you'll hit.\

Be careful with lasers, treat them like a loaded gun. It is very easy to create dangerous situations with a laser if you're not careful, be responsible and eliminate that possibility!

Right now, the first project for this technology (Lithography Spinner V1) is in the research/idea stage. See work in progress page for details on upcoming tasks if you want to contribute.
