# Blu-Ray Lithography

## Introduction

This is the project page for a lithography system based on repurposing Blu-Ray drives. The initial goal is to reach a feature size of at least 500nm (2x the Blu-ray laser spot size). As a stretch goal, we would like to also use the sled and spindle motors as high speed nano-positioners and to spin coat and cure photo-resin.

## Safety

Wear [UV-blocking glasses](https://www.amazon.com/Tool-Klean-Safety-Glasses-Protection/dp/B081BHTJT8/ref=sr_1_5?crid=38LVX5C7MIN2M\&keywords=uv+protection+glasses\&qid=1674228429\&sprefix=uv+protection+%2Caps%2C96\&sr=8-5) whenever light leakage from the device is possible.

Right now, the first project for this technology (Lithography Spinner V1) is in the research/idea stage. See work in progress page for details on upcoming tasks if you want to contribute.
