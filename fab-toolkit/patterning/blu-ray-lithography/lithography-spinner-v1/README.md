# Lithography Spinner V1

## Introduction

The Lithography Spinner V1 plans to use the Blu-Ray disc assembly from a Play Station 5 (KEM-497AAA) to drive the whole system. They are readily available and can be found for $30-$70 in most places.

Typically a single IC is used to drive these modules but most vendors wont sell chips to individuals. So the plan is to design a discrete controller board to manage all the HW and write our own controller SW.
