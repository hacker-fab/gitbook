# BU40N Reference Design

Introduction

In order to develop the SW for Texas Instruments TPIC2050 and test a good bit of the system, I have ordered a BU40N blu-ray module that although available online may not be available for long. What i like about this module is that as long as I remove the MT1950 chip I can get access to a lot of the pins of interest. Also powering it is relatively simple as it should only need 5V.
