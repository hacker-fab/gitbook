# BU40N Reference Design

## Introduction

In order to develop the SW for Texas Instruments TPIC2050 and test a good bit of the system, the BU40N blu-ray module was chosen for early development. Although available online, this module may not be available for long which is what disqualifies it from general use. Removing the MT1950 chip allows access to a lot of the pins of interest. Powering it is also relatively simple as it should only need 5V.
