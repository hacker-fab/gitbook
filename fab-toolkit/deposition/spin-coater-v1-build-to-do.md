# ðŸ’¿ Spin Coater V1 Build (WIP)

Here is a [BOM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n8dB-Vh3pZN99sLe7-j91mzc43uWQ1A1lQEvetoBo_8/edit?gid=0#gid=0) of the most recent spin coater V1 build at CMU. More build info to come soon!

* Collect all necessary measurements of the current spin-coater to create the new 3D model.
* Finalize an updated 3D model that includes the servo mount and any necessary adjustments to the lid design.
* Order required components, including a servo motor, necessary mounting brackets, and plastic material for a redesigned lid.
* Cut and prepare the new lid, ensuring proper fit and clearance for rotation
* Assemble all components and build the initial prototype.
* Conduct preliminary functionality tests, focusing on servo movement and integration with the claw mechanism.
* Optimize servo rotation angles and positioning to maximize clearance while minimizing occupied space.
* Conduct final system tests to verify smooth automation and reliable lid operation.
* Implement necessary refinements and finalize the design for long-term use.
