# Sky Bailey

Hey, I'm Sky! I'm going to be working on the Litho Stepper team this semester.



## Weekly Update 1

1. This week I had many discussions with Joel, Kent, and Carson about my project for this semester, and what we settled on was pretty much "build a Stepper V2.1", with the goal of reusing most of the approach and design of Stepper V2, but reducing cost and hopefully improving results. My proposal is here (with the changes we discussed in class at the top): [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ep3-e0HO9AmtpUUeflvEykCd4FP-uaUSemOyMItGfMc/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ep3-e0HO9AmtpUUeflvEykCd4FP-uaUSemOyMItGfMc/edit?tab=t.0)
2. The main roadblock for me is time management: I'm juggling several project courses currently so hopefully I can get into the swing of things this coming week, now that eCTF's workload is starting to even out.
3. Next week I plan to formally take the ideas discussed after presenting my proposal to the team and make a concrete task list: one of those tasks will be working with Joel to order parts, which I also plan to do this coming week.
