# Week 3 Updates

The lab automation team received an update this week that we basically had to re-vamp a large portion of the project, since the gantry was(apparently) no longer deemed necessary. Our goals were reset so that everyone on the team was set to work on the "NEW" lab automation plan, which was to combine the liquidation handling, the spin coater, and the thermal heating system.



For starters, me and the rest of the team took a look at an iteration of the three in one spin coater that was already on the internet(and made at an extremely cheap price) as well.&#x20;

Of course, since this was an extremely low budget design, we realized that there were several improvements we could make. For starters, the liquid handling system is basically composed of a single syringe, as well as a better solvent catch bowl system to collect excess liquids. Along with that, a more efficient vacuum system would benefit the spin coater, since the current iteration does not suction the silicon hard enough to keep it in place consistently at higher rpm.&#x20;



When it comes to major roadblocks, several new variables came into mind once we decided to merge all the components of lab automation into one. **The biggest one** for sure as of now, is the fact that we may have to pursue a different filament or material for the base of the spin coater due to there being a solid chance of it not being able to withstand the heat. The original spin coater was also not stationary enough(due to how light it was), so utilizing aluminum as the base instead was a suggestion that came to mind. Other roadblocks include, as mentioned, improving the vacuum system of the spin coater, minimizing motors(since the less moving parts, the easier time we will have), and attaching an updated liquid handling system that can alternate between different chemicals(since we have to differentiate which liquids are which within the tube)

**For next week**, I plan on initially CADing the base design of the spin coater(while taking into account the liquid handling + thermal heating) , and attempting to help Adwoa move her Fusion360 file of the perstaltic pump to onshape(while maintaining her sketches).&#x20;
