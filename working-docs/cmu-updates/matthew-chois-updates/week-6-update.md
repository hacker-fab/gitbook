# Week 6 Update

What was accomplished:&#x20;

1. Finished working on the PPT for Tuesday, and took major feedback on issues with peristaltic pump(including potential issues with air being pumped out instead of actual liquid)
2. Re-designed a spin coater to fit on to the overall automated assembly
3. Read about other spin coater + liquid handling setups, and how they managed to deal with liquid handling consistency issues(**THEY USED SYRINGE NEEDLES SINCE THEY WILL PREVENT LIQUID FROM FLOWING DOWN WHILE AIR CAN SO ATTACHING IT TO THE SILICON WOULD SOLVE POTENTIAL ISSUES WITH NON-CHEMICALS**)

Roadblocks/issues:

1. Not sure if the current silicone tubing for the peristaltic pump is small enough to attach re-usable syringe needles
2. Need to debug peristaltic pump accuracy for accuracy regarding how consistent liquid handling is(we can do something like 3 trials for consistent 5 ml of liquid to debug)

TO DOs:

1. CAD a new control panel for the overall raspberry pi setup
2. Order components for SMALLER silicone tubing with luer locks(that can attach a syringe needle), as well as linear actuators and silicone/glass syringes, since they allow easier control of precise liquid handling control
