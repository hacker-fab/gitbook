# Week 7 Update

What was accomplished:&#x20;

* redesigned original spin coater design to suit Lab automation needs(by removing all mounting needed for LCD and buttons, and minimizing dimensions to fit the assembly)
* designed the syringe liquid handling design CAD on onshape, as well as ordering components for them
* Wrote down the hackerfab midsemester documentation

Roadblocks/issues:

* Finding the right syringe for liquid handling, since the main issue was finding a syringe with the right specifications. We needed our syringe to be made out of PTFE or glass, but a majority of the ones we found were made of polyethylene, which would eventually wear out due to acetone and IPA.&#x20;
* The measurements for the nozzle of the syringe that we ordered was flawed(2mm is not equivalent to 0.4 inches), so we had to take into account the chance that the nozzle isn't the same measurement as advertised
* The nozzle of the syringe was also not meant for locking syringes(but were still ordered in case we would switch back to plastic syringes), so we would have to potentially find a way to attach a needle onto the tubing from the syringe

TO DOs:

* Debug the lead screw stepper motor we have to calibrate the amount of liquid would needed to coat/clean a chip
