# Week 12 Update

What was Accomplished:

* Developed the Demo 2 presentation for updates
* Tested STEPs for electronics with the stepper motor
* Updated the clamp mechanism for the mounting system

Roadblocks:

* Potential issue with the limit of the stepper motor not being calibrated properly(will eventually add a nut as a true limiter)
* The clamp mechanism is still not as great as I want( the print was slightly defected, and will replace)

Plans for next week:

* print new syringe pump WITH mounting holes and cad mounting system for lab automation
* Work with callum to finalize touches on liquid handling mounting for the tubing
