# Week 8 Update

What was accomplished:&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/20250315_143052 (1).jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* assembled stepper motor electronics setup, and updated arduino code so that it would revolve precisely ONCE(should work on the final assembly, since we are using the same stepper motor) WITH a button setup
* re-designed spin coater CAD on onshape
* planned out a roadmap on how to assemble electronics(have a single arduino mega controlling everything, or find a way to "link" smaller microcontrollers together)

Roadblocks/issues:

* The cable that needs to be used is micro usb, and there are no cables that I could find that directly connect onto my labtop(only has C cable connections, not sure if there is a micro usb -> usb c cable)
* The stepper motor requires a different voltage from the microcontroller, so either a second power supply is needed for the microcontroller, or a voltage de-regulator(12v to 5v) is required in the electronics setup

TO DOs:

* Once syringe arrives, take measurements of it, before modifying 3d printed parts in previous cad according to those measurements, and begin testing
