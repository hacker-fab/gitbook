This week, I dedicated time to writing up the proposal for changes to be made to the spin coater, ensuring that all necessary modifications were clearly outlined to improve its efficiency and functionality. I had planned to coordinate with Anirud on a call to discuss dimensional specifications, but unfortunately, scheduling conflicts prevented the meeting from happening. However, despite this setback, I was able to make progress in other areas by joining the Fusion file and actively working on the prototype for versions 2 and 3. This stage of development is crucial as I refine the design and implement improvements based on previous iterations. Moving forward, I plan to continue prototyping while also rescheduling the call with Anirud to finalize key specifications and ensure that everything is on track.
