Created project proposal and started reading Alicat and Pfieffer manuals to understand how to connect microcontroller to them. Alicat uses MODBUS RTU protocol and connects through a DB9 cord. In the following week, I will finishing finding out how to communicate with all the sputtering parameters and starting writing code to communicate with gas controller and vaccum pump. Communication with parameters will be kept here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e5NmWFM19hEzyVlvQo01xP2gn9aTncJCWMAtZo8TncQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e5NmWFM19hEzyVlvQo01xP2gn9aTncJCWMAtZo8TncQ/edit?usp=sharing) and will be added to the hackerFab drive.
