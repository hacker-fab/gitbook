## Update 0

### Progress

* Researched pinch valves for new system design and suggested to the team.
* Looked into high torque motors and stepper motors with gearboxes so I can increase the torque being applied on the peristaltic pump.
* Chose a new motor to order to revamp the system.

### Roadblocks

* None. I just to need to order parts.

### Plans

* I will update the peristaltic pump 3d model to be compatible with a stepper motor that has a gear box attached.
* I will order a stepper motor that has a gear box.
* I will work on code for making the stepper motor move more smoothly.

## Update 1

Our project objective has changed to a single integrated design for spin coater and heating since last week. I still am working on liquid handling, but Matthew is doing the On-shape CAD for the pump instead.

### Progress

* Researched fittings & valves that work with our chemicals.
  * Polypropylene will work for most of our chemicals. It is **very compatible** with HMDS, Acetone, IPA, AZ P4210 (Photoresist). It is **likely also compatible** with Spin-on-glass 700B and P504 based on their compositions.
  * There are **fully polypropylene valves** we can use and just attach an actuator to instead of making our own valves and I think we should pursue this if it will take up less space.
* Ordered a stepper motor with gear box and the appropriate components to drive and power it.
* Worked on stepper code.

### Roadblocks

* I am waiting for the parts I ordered to arrive.

### Plans

* Meet up with Matthew and 3D print the peristaltic pump CAD from On-shape.
* Test pump functions.
* Look into how we can order the fittings and valves.
