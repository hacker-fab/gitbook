## **Update 0**

Focus for this week is to create a plan to quantify the errors in the current litho stepper. Work on my tormach 440 cnc machine to have "in house" machining capability.&#x20;

Preliminary Readings: ISO 230 Geometric accuracy of machines operating under no-load or quasi-static conditions, Foundations of Mechanical Accuracy, Precision Machine Design.&#x20;

### Next Steps

Create a project proposal

## **Update 1 (11/26/2025)**

### Accomplishments

* Created project proposal, received input from litho-stepper team and edited the proposal by added target values for mechanical accuracy of proposed nano-positioner.
* Welded a steel coolant tank using TIG (tungsten inert gas) welding. Leak tested the coolant tank by filling it with water and waiting to see if the tank leaked. There were several pinhole leaks.

* Looked at the cad files for this open source piezo nano-positioner. [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468067222000621](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468067222000621)
* Created spreadsheet of potential tooling required for CNC milling nano-positioner parts.
* Started on creating the documentation for measuring the mechanical accuracy of Stepper V2.&#x20;

### Roadblocks

**Problem 1**

Coolant tank was not watertight. suspected cause was contamination from inadequate surface prep as well as skill issues with TIG (tungsten inert gas) welding. An attempt was made to braze the locations of leaks but a second leak test was not attempted due to time.

**Proposed Solutions**

* Grind out areas that have leaks, weld the leak locations again.
* Buy a coolant tank.

**Problem 2**

Did not finish documentation on test cases due to time overrun with coolant tank task.

**Proposed Solution**

Carry over task to the next week.

**Problem 3**

Unsure about who reviews my gitbook updates as well as github project tracker usage.

**Proposed Solution**

Ask at the next meeting.

### Next Steps

**Measurement:**

* Measure the mechanical accuracy of Stepper V2.

**Machining:**

* Order tooling.
* Order material.
* Tram the head of the CNC machine.
* PI tune CNC machine spindle motor.

**Nano Positioner:**

* Create a plan for machining mechanical parts of the nanopositioner.
* Work on CAM (computer aided manufacturing) for one loose tolerance part.

**Carry Over Tasks:**

* Create and document plan to measure the mechanical accuracy&#x20;
