## **Week 0**

Focus for this week is to create a plan to quantify the errors in the current litho stepper. Work on my tormach 440 cnc machine to have "in house" machining capability.&#x20;

Preliminary Readings: ISO 230 Geometric accuracy of machines operating under no-load or quasi-static conditions, Foundations of Mechanical Accuracy, Precision Machine Design.&#x20;

### Next Steps

Create a project proposal
