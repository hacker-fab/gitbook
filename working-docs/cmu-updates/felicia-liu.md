**Weekly Update #1**

Work done:

I drafted project proposal and set goals/timeline on what we plan to achieve this semester with two other teammates in the EDA device modeling subteam ([https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sCj4PGeCfQZ3DJODLZkjC7j2guPgpSJxxSDldw\_wTm8/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sCj4PGeCfQZ3DJODLZkjC7j2guPgpSJxxSDldw_wTm8/edit?tab=t.0)).

I focused on figuring out what tool to use for the SPICE model simulation. We decided to go with KiCad's schematic tool which has an embedded open-sourced SPICE simulator Ngspice. It supports custom MOSFET SPICE model definition and can export SPICE netlist from schematics.

Roadblocks:

Had some confusion about which tool was the best to use but resolved.

Plan for next week:

Try simulating with the initial MOSFET model with process parameters calculated from last semester's chip. Figure out what parameter is still needed to build a higher precision MOSFET model and coordinate with other teams involved to develop a testing plan.
