#### Weekly Update #0&#x20;

1. Familiarized myself with the project, by reading the project primer and F24 documentation to assess what has been completed and what are the next steps. Had the initial group meeting with the team and was presented with two problems to be tackled this semester. Performed a literature review on both problems, including the suggested reading "Modern Semiconductor Devices for Integrated Circuits" (chapters 1, 4, 5, 6). Achieved a satisfactory comprehension of both problems and became inclined toward one of them.
2. The major challenge was getting familiarized with new concepts. No roadblocks at the time.
3. Determine the problem to tackle. Define a concrete plan and write the project proposal.

#### Weekly Update #1

1. Determined that I am going to be working on the metal contacts problem. Performed a literature review to better understand it. Reviewed previous documentation to assess the current state of the problem in the lab and determine what will be my first steps. Came up with a plan and wrote the proposal.
2. No roadblocks at the time.
3. Will have the first training in the lab with the team.  Will receive feedback from the project proposal and define concrete first steps and determine what changes need to be made to the initial plan.
