### <mark style="background-color:blue;">Weekly Update #0 (Jan 18)</mark>

#### <mark style="color:blue;">Accomplished this week</mark>

Familiarized myself with the project, by reading the project primer and F24 documentation to assess what has been completed and what are the next steps. Had the initial group meeting with the team and was presented with two problems to be tackled this semester. Performed a literature review on both problems, including the suggested reading "Modern Semiconductor Devices for Integrated Circuits" (chapters 1, 4, 5, 6). Achieved a satisfactory comprehension of both problems and became inclined toward one of them.

#### <mark style="color:blue;">Roadblocks/Challenges</mark>

The major challenge was getting familiarized with new concepts. No roadblocks at the time.

#### <mark style="color:blue;">Plans for next week</mark>

Determine the problem to tackle. Define a concrete plan and write the project proposal.

### <mark style="background-color:blue;">Weekly Update #1 (Jan 26)</mark>

#### <mark style="color:blue;">Accomplished this week</mark>

Determined that I am going to be working on the metal contacts problem. Performed a literature review to better understand it. Reviewed previous documentation to assess the current state of the problem in the lab and determine what will be my first steps. Came up with a plan and wrote the proposal.

#### <mark style="color:blue;">Roadblocks/Challenges</mark>

No roadblocks at the time.

#### <mark style="color:blue;">Plans for next week</mark>

Will have the first training in the lab with the team.  Will receive feedback from the project proposal and define concrete first steps and determine what changes need to be made to the initial plan.

Tasks: [https://github.com/orgs/hacker-fab/projects/35/views/1](https://github.com/orgs/hacker-fab/projects/35/views/1)

#### <mark style="color:blue;">Accomplished this week:</mark>

* Completed all the training that was needed to start fabrication.&#x20;
* Created Fabublox process for baseline testing ([https://www.fabublox.com/process-editor/2b1a8f1f-8915-4e10-83a6-1cb50809dc19](https://www.fabublox.com/process-editor/2b1a8f1f-8915-4e10-83a6-1cb50809dc19))
* Created Fabublox process for annealing testing ([https://www.fabublox.com/process-editor/0bf4952c-a946-4297-88c2-b4ad10fb9143](https://www.fabublox.com/process-editor/0bf4952c-a946-4297-88c2-b4ad10fb9143))
* Created Fabublox process for Ni contacts testing ([https://www.fabublox.com/process-editor/dd27629e-aa67-4ec5-8450-e68649ff62fc](https://www.fabublox.com/process-editor/dd27629e-aa67-4ec5-8450-e68649ff62fc))
* Defined the parameters to be extracted from IV and CV measurements ([https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kRxrYw\_IqMbyyWSPSQffWJJDcG3zCKjm/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=104911347651865134602\&rtpof=true\&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kRxrYw_IqMbyyWSPSQffWJJDcG3zCKjm/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=104911347651865134602\&rtpof=true\&sd=true))
* Started the chip fabrication for baseline testing following my Fabublox process flow

#### <mark style="color:blue;">Roadblocks/Challenges:</mark>

Fabrication this week could have been better. Started with 3 chips but lost 2 in the spin coater. Decided to take this first fabrication to the end with only the remaining chip. I would say my major challenge is getting accustomed to the equipment and processes.

#### <mark style="color:blue;">Plans for next week:</mark>

* In terms of fabrication, my plan is to have at least 3 viable chips ready for baseline measurements&#x20;
* If everything goes well with the fabrication, the plan is also to start making some measurements with TLM and extract valuable parameters
* In parallel, I would like to start doing some research on possible differences in metal-Si contact behavior for both p type and n type Si and assess the viability of introducing these in further testings
