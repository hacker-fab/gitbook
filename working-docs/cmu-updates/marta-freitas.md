#### Weekly Update #0&#x20;

1. Familiarized myself with the project, by reading the project primer and F24 documentation to assess what has been completed and what are the next steps. Had the initial group meeting with the team and was presented with two problems to be tackled this semester. Performed a literature review on both problems, including the suggested reading "Modern Semiconductor Devices for Integrated Circuits" (chapters 1, 4, 5, 6). Achieved a satisfactory comprehension of both problems and became inclined toward one of them.
2. The major challenge was getting familiarized with new concepts. No roadblocks at the time.
3. Determine the problem to tackle. Define a concrete plan and write the project proposal.
