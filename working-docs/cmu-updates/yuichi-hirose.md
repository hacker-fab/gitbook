# Yuichi Hirose

**Weekly Update #0&1 (1/13 - 1/26)**

#### Accomplishments

* I was first assigned to the wire bonder development. I joined the wire bonder tutorial with Joe and Joel to get to know how to use it. I had a discussion with Icey, James, Joe, and Joel, and we decided to prioritize the probe station development and the other parts of IC packaging except DIYing a wire bonder for this semester. I was assigned to the development of a probe station.
* I had a discussion with Anirud and Joel to understand the current situation of the probe station (what have been finished, what not, and what I am supposed to do this semester). Anirud showed me the current prototype from last semester, which helped my understanding.
* I looked through [the documents and CAD from the last semester](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IgyzVxSDXMU6CBSJqW16NdSuTSvhQFkJ) to understand the situation more.
* I created [a project proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_nHKy9RG0kd6QQrEui08GBJlWizaZtv6Z8CEiLkyzpo/edit?usp=sharing).
* I had a discussion with Anirud, Joe, and Joel again to review my project proposal.
  * We decided to use off-the-shelf XYZ positioners and work on a DIY XYZ positioner develepment only if time allows.
  * Because we are going to use off-the-shelf XYZ positioners, we can also use off-the-shelf probes. We don't have to design and DIY them.
  * The camera can be replaced with a USB camera. Another team is also procuring one, so it might be good to obtain the same one for us. C-mount cameras might be benefitial for easy design and assembly.
  * Vacuum chuck is necessary. Lab already has a vacuum pump. We need to obtain a chuck (the one procured last semester is too large).
  * We would like to automate the Z-axis positioning. We need to attach a motor to the Z-axis of the off-the-shelf positioner.
  * Priority: finishing a working DIY probe station > auto-Z function.

#### Roadblocks

* These tasks might already be underway by someone, but I'll write down for record
  * XYZ positioner procurement
  * Probe procurement
  * USB camera procurement
  * Vacuum chuck procurement
* How to implement auto-Z? (Force sensor? High-res encoder?)

#### Plans for next week

* Design of a metallic base which XYZ positioners can be attached with magnet.



**Weekly Update #2**&#x20;

I was able to complete all the Github project tracker tasks I set out to do last week as well as talk to the lab automation team to figure out what they need from us on the database.&#x20;
