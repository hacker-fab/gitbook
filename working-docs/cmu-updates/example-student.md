**Weekly Update #1**

I did some preliminary research, you can find the task for this in github project tracker here: xxx I drew some schematics for the Database, which can be found in the master doc here: xxx. I am facing the challenge of IV curves appearing to be limited by power. I am reaching out on the Diligent forum. My plans for next week are to do these GitHub project tracker tasks:&#x20;



**Weekly Update #2**&#x20;

I was able to complete all the Github project tracker tasks I set out to do last week as well as talk to the lab automation team to figure out what they need from us on the database.&#x20;
