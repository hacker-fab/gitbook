**Weekly Update #2**

1. **What was accomplished:**
   1. Created a mask with rectangles of various sizes to test scale factor of phidl grid units to micrometers. ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/rectangles (1) (1).png>)
   2. Learned how to use the stepper, and SOP for patterning.
   3. Talked to the stepper team and decided on a cross with 1 elongated side as the marker shape of choice for now.
   4. Generated code that turns GDSII files into a png.
2. **Roadblocks:**
   1. Gina and I went into lab Sunday night to learn how to pattern, but the spin coater was unusable due to the vacuum being too weak.&#x20;
      1. We were unable to actually pattern a chip and measure the scale factor of grid units to micrometers.
3. **Plans for next week:**
   1. Pattern a chip with the mask above, and measure the sides of each rectangle to determine the scale factor.&#x20;
   2. Research Magic VLSI tool.
   3. Learn more about phidl layers, and how to implement them for more complex masks.

**Weekly Update #1**&#x20;

1. **What was accomplished:**
   1. Determined that I would be working with Gina on mask automation and DRC rules.
   2. Planned out the semester week-by-week with action items for the Project Proposal. ([https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wVFeGedLbJkedMMWSoLg0EdzVot8mtU53Ke8EUfJB6Y/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wVFeGedLbJkedMMWSoLg0EdzVot8mtU53Ke8EUfJB6Y/edit?usp=sharing))
   3. Looked over the current progress and code for mask generation and DRC rules in the HackerFab Git repo.
2. **Roadblocks:**
   1. Gina and I will need to begin fabrication of single layers to determine the aspect ratio of the current mask generation code, but we have not had a lab session yet.&#x20;
      1. With Lab 1 next week, we hopefully will learn how to create a single layer, and be able to test different unit lengths in the current mask generation code.
3. **Plans for next week:**
   1. Learn how to fabricate single layers.
   2. Look more into phidl, graphics packages that allow for users to input or drag and drop shapes, and some examples of DRC rules.
   3. Experiment with exporting jpg files from the current mask generation code.&#x20;

**Weekly Update #0:**

1. **What was accomplished:**
   1. Read over EDA primer and looked into the resources linked.
   2. Did some searching on adding pdk to Cadence.
2. **Roadblocks:**
   1. No roadblocks at the moment.
3. **Plans for next week:**
   1. Figure out how to help the EDA team this semester.
      1. Currently thinking of creating a template for Cadence pdk files.
