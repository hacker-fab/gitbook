**Weekly Update #1**

* ALD:  
I went through the primer and documentation to understand the basics of the project. I selected the delivery system as my main project for the semester.
Current struggle is going to be tracking down CAD that was previously done for the project. I plan to read more into the specific design requirements for the delivery system
and look through the CAD to understand what models of existing parts I will need to source/create.

  
* Packaging:  
We started with a rough idea to build our own wirebonder, but after the meeting with Icey from the CMOS team, we decided that using the exisiting one
in the MEMs lab is sufficient for this semester. So instead I will be working more on a solution to package our silicon chips for this semester.
After talking to Joe, we decided to start by purchasing lead frames for testing and we are having trouble finding a complete DIP package that we can buy online.

Some notes from Friday's meeting with Icey:  
* pads will be done with thermal evaporator - has AL capacity
* we should watch out for resistance at connection
* at MEMs lab pads are 200umx200um (larger is reccomended), need at least 300um-500um ish between each pad
* our chips are currently 1cmx1cm
* bond wires can extend to a few cm long


Going forward I will look into different options for packaging (pads on PCB or attempt to replicate DIP package from industry)
I will also start to explore manufacturing methods and some design requirements for our IC package.
