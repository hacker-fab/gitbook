# Alex Echols

## Update 0

### Progress Updates

* Reviewed documentation from the Fall 2024 semester
* Had initial group meeting with ALD team to delegate roles and discuss next steps
* Began planning for ALD chamber passthroughs and substrate heater thermal characterization

### Roadblocks

* No major roadblocks to report

### Plans

* Review literature on material compatibility with precursor chemicals and vacuum design
* Detail experimental procedure for substrate heater characterization
  * Understand the relationship between input voltage/current and output temperature/temperature rate
  * Ensure heater uniformity
* Draft project proposal

## Update 1

### Progress Updates

* Created experimental design for profiling substrate heater
* Began updating 3D CAD of the substrate heater and ALD chamber
* Reviewed literature on material compatibility with precursor materials (for heater parts)
* Drafted and submitted semester project proposal

### Roadblocks

* No major roadblocks to report

### Plans

* Continue to work on CAD of the chamber assembly
  * Preliminary designs for the entire heater stack, including chamber mounting by EOW
* Begin research on compatible tubing and passthroughs
* Create plan for making Aflas O-Rings from cording
