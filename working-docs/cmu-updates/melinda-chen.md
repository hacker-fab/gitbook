### Update 0

#### Accomplishments

* Read through sputtering documentation and project primers
* Read through required textbook chapters and 'Filling in the Gaps' resources
* Met with project partner Katie to go through project goals and potential avenues forward
* Walked through state of current sputter chamber with team leads

#### Roadblocks

* No major blocks so far

#### Plans

* Literature review of current characterization techniques
* Meet with Katie to draft project proposal and timeline

### Update 1 (1/19-1/26)

#### Accomplishments

* Drafted project proposal and timeline
* Researched thin film characterization techniques
* Submitted requests for training on XRR (with Professor Sokalski) and AFM
* Compiled existing sputtering chamber setups from online sources into spreadsheet
* Performed sputtering trials using Aluminum target + practiced tuning pressure using Argon flow rate and vacuum strength to maintain stable plasma

#### Roadblocks

* Priority is figuring out why the sputtering current is so low + how to tune sputtering parameters to improve power

#### Plans

* Get trained on XRR next Thursday
* Continue literature review&#x20;
* Sputtering trials with Aluminum target --> Try sparking using high flow rate to create dense plasma then lowering pressure to increase amount of sputtered particles that reach the substrate
