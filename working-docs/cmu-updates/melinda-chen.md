### Update 0

#### Accomplishments

* Read through sputtering documentation and project primers
* Read through required textbook chapters and 'Filling in the Gaps' resources
* Met with project partner Katie to go through project goals and potential avenues forward
* Walked through state of current sputter chamber with team leads

#### Roadblocks

* No major blocks so far

#### Plans

* Literature review of current characterization techniques
* Meet with Katie to draft project proposal and timeline

### Update 1 (1/19-1/26)

#### Accomplishments

* Drafted project proposal and timeline
* Researched thin film characterization techniques
* Submitted requests for training on XRR (with Professor Sokalski) and AFM
* Compiled existing sputtering chamber setups from online sources into spreadsheet
* Performed sputtering trials using Aluminum target + practiced tuning pressure using Argon flow rate and vacuum strength to maintain stable plasma

#### Roadblocks

* Priority is figuring out why the sputtering current is so low + how to tune sputtering parameters to improve power

#### Plans

* Get trained on XRR next Thursday
* Continue literature review&#x20;
* Sputtering trials with Aluminum target --> Try sparking using high flow rate to create dense plasma then lowering pressure to increase amount of sputtered particles that reach the substrate

### Update 2 (1/20-2/2)

#### Accomplishments

* Met with Professor Sokalski to discuss XRR&#x20;
* Assisted chamber modifications for RF sputtering
* RF Sputtering trial with Aluminum target
  * learned how to use RF sputtering equipment and fundamentals behind impedance matching
* Chamber bias literature review
* Completed AFM online training and reached out to MCF contact for in-person training

#### Roadblocks

* Main roadblock is still sputtering chamber not working - will continue to look into specific reasons why target seems completely unscathed after a few hours of being near plasma
* Some of the RF sputtering electronics are cooked

#### Plans

* AFM in-person training
* Continue sputtering chamber debugging - both literature review and in-person tests
* Ideally also XRR in-person training, depends on how fast MCF contact responds.

### Update 3 (2/2-2/9)

#### Accomplishments

* Completed XRR training with Besty
* Completed AFM training
* Contacted Andrew to ask about correct AFM tips
* Helped perform sputtering tests on Thursday and Saturday to try to debug chamber

#### Roadblocks

* Sputtering chamber still not working - blocking capacitor seems like promising solution

#### Plans

* Perform sputtering test with Aluminum Oxide/Insulating material to test blocking capacitor theory
* Perform XRR on sample similar to expected sputtering chamber output
* Start writing SOPs + Drawing out schematic of characterization pipeline
