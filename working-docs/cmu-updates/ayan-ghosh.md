Update 1:

I have taken the measurements of the build plate and started CAD for the cable fixture. Unfortunately I can't figure out how to attach it here but it is waterjetted aluminum. I will in the coming week look for stock in TechSpark and fabricate it.



Update 2:

Not part of my core work but will be helpful in the future: I have made CAD of the chamber. I will post the drawings in the Discord, unless there's a better place to put them.&#x20;

I was planning to waterjet the fixture for the cathode cable, but I didn't see any stock of a good size in Techspark; may end up ordering them. The other part of the shielding I'm fairly certain can be done with just a bunch of teflon and more RG400 cable. (The fixture will clamp on to the cable.)

So to get started I need some thin aluminum sheets, a couple thin nuts and bolts (I can adjust the holes to match whatever's available), some more RG400 and a bunch of teflon sheets; I suspect most of these we already have at the build meeting on Monday I'll look for these. That being said, all of these are pretty basic, I even saw a significant length of RG400 for <$6 ([https://www.dxengineering.com/parts/dxe-rg400-ctl?srsltid=AfmBOoqpcVcfdrx0d7jDs5ido94fmxBubg6Uw7K3ME8gJ8qZkJ\_Yp7dr](https://www.dxengineering.com/parts/dxe-rg400-ctl?srsltid=AfmBOoqpcVcfdrx0d7jDs5ido94fmxBubg6Uw7K3ME8gJ8qZkJ_Yp7dr)) so just buying would be OK to.

Just a quick note, I've been finding it a little annoying to trawl through the documentation to find the relevant info; the documents are rather long and often I scroll so long I forget what I'm looking for. This was part of the motivation for making the CAD. (I just kept measuring stuff on the chamber.)

Goals for this week are to order the materials and waterjet, I think it'll be possible to get this shielding issue done around Saturday, but we'll see.

_Update 1 feedback:_

_Thanks for the update. For the future, it would be great if you can add some more detail in what progress you have made as well as list specific tasks you plan on working on in the next week so we can ensure we are staying on track. Please also include if you have any setbacks (or mention that there are none) in your updates._

_For any CADs or diagrams, it's fine if you just include a screenshot or link to a drive or something just so we can see what you're working on. Thanks_
