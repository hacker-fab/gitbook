# Ying Meng

**Weekly Update #1**

I created this Gitbook page.



**Weekly Update #2**

The EDA team breaks down into Device Modeling and DRC Mask Design. I chose to be in the Device Modeling team helping with creating SPICE model simulation. The three of us wrote the project proposal together here [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sCj4PGeCfQZ3DJODLZkjC7j2guPgpSJxxSDldw\_wTm8/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sCj4PGeCfQZ3DJODLZkjC7j2guPgpSJxxSDldw_wTm8/edit?tab=t.0) and revised it with Icey. We divided the research work and planned to finish it before our next meeting on Tuesday. I'm in charge of researching MOSFET models with different precision along with the SPICE parameters required from each model and suggest one to follow first. Details of my work are recorded here [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GPqJ3GYlR0PzqFpR4nMNGcOII4sagbmCd-OWbnomDD0/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GPqJ3GYlR0PzqFpR4nMNGcOII4sagbmCd-OWbnomDD0/edit?tab=t.0).
