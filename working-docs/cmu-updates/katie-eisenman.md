### Update 0

#### Accomplishments

* Read sputtering documents from last semester, read project primers
* Did the prereadings and spent time making sure I understood the fabrication processes as this is mostly new information for me
* Met with my partner Melinda for the sputter process project and helped each other understand the current state of the project and our task
* Met the rest of the sputter team and saw the sputter chamber in person to see how it works

#### Roadblocks

* Nothing major so far,  there's just a lot of new content to learn quickly but I think I have a good handle on it

#### Plans

* Review external literature to prepare for project proposal
* Meet with Melinda to discuss our plans and split up responsibilities
* Draft project proposal
