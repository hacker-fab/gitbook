### Update 2

#### Accomplishments

* Met with Professor Sokalski to learn more about XRR and how it works. It seems like it will be the best tool to determine sample thickness and potentially density. I took notes during the meeting that can be found here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/11MBv83tX0nFboJv7nk2iF1xpBTiB1wlXRQb5I7Rys-I/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11MBv83tX0nFboJv7nk2iF1xpBTiB1wlXRQb5I7Rys-I/edit?tab=t.0)
* Ran an RF trial on the sputtering chamber with Jay, Melinda, Rahim, and Ayan. We tested several different parameter combinations, starting by changing the frequency, then altering the argon pressure and thus chamber pressure. Unfortunately, nothing was sputtered onto the slide and a piece of the system broke during our test. I recorded observations and the parameters tested, which can be found here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1djYb2jFaWNsHtIddbWhw9eNRoR0uh7QR40o2pBkO11E/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1djYb2jFaWNsHtIddbWhw9eNRoR0uh7QR40o2pBkO11E/edit?tab=t.0)
* I did the first lab! (And only dropped the chip like three (?) times)

#### Roadblocks

* The main roadblock is that so far we haven't got the chamber to sputter an observable layer. Jay, Melinda, and I are going to scour the literature to try and determine the problem (maybe DC bias on the target, maybe something else) and find a solution.&#x20;

#### Plans

* Do AFM training with Melinda this Thursday (it can complement XRR so I think it's worth having the option)
* Read more literature to try and find a solution to the lack of sputtered material
* Perform more RF trials and try to get samples to use for XRR/AFM so we can start developing a protocol
* Do the next part of the lab

### Update 1

#### Accomplishments

* Saw and helped operate the sputtering chamber twice
* Developed proposal with Melinda for what we are going to accomplish for the sputtering proccess this semester
* Worked with Jay and Melinda to make our first samples
* Requested AFM training, scheduled a meeting with Professor Sokalski to discuss XRR/XRD for thin films

#### Roadblocks

* Nothing aside from being out of town this past weekend, which just meant I didn't have time to do much work

#### Plans

* Start reading literature on how to characterize thin films with XRR, AFM, and other techniques
* Perform more sputtering trials and get better at operating the chamber independently
* Do the first lab

### Update 0

#### Accomplishments

* Read sputtering documents from last semester, read project primers
* Did the prereadings and spent time making sure I understood the fabrication processes as this is mostly new information for me
* Met with my partner Melinda for the sputter process project and helped each other understand the current state of the project and our task
* Met the rest of the sputter team and saw the sputter chamber in person to see how it works

#### Roadblocks

* Nothing major so far,  there's just a lot of new content to learn quickly but I think I have a good handle on it

#### Plans

* Review external literature to prepare for project proposal
* Meet with Melinda to discuss our plans and split up responsibilities
* Draft project proposal
