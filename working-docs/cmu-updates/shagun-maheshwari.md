# Shagun Maheshwari

## Update 2:

Progress Update:

* Did research on performing an RCA clean and wrote the SOP of the RCA clean we will conduct here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EJc17dcLvwOp3yGAgUv3rpoIKi2gON022oEVz9VkTkE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EJc17dcLvwOp3yGAgUv3rpoIKi2gON022oEVz9VkTkE/edit?usp=sharing)
* Added initial notes for RCA clean to the CMOS process dev master doc: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1566Sux3ALGOfexcq4ajqJ6XRDOvNgEnyw1Al20tyuYY/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1566Sux3ALGOfexcq4ajqJ6XRDOvNgEnyw1Al20tyuYY/edit?tab=t.0)
* Built a FabuBlocks process for the p-type MOScap fabrication here + got feedback from Cesely : [https://www.fabublox.com/process-editor/b12fd11e-5a87-4d3f-ad97-d2f436606290](https://www.fabublox.com/process-editor/b12fd11e-5a87-4d3f-ad97-d2f436606290)
* Created the solutions for SC-1 and SC-2 we will be using for the RCA clean within the fume hood
* Completed phase 1 of the Resistor lab&#x20;
* Got HF training done&#x20;
* Got Evaporator training done&#x20;
* Got Fume Hood training done&#x20;



Roadblocks:&#x20;

* No current roadblocks, tube furnace seemed to have died so couldn't make the p-type MOScap last week but it seems to have been fixed so I can do that next week



Plans:&#x20;

* Conduct an RCA clean following my SOP
* Fab a p-type MOScap
* Read through chapters 4 and 5 of Modern Semiconductor devices for Integrated circuits again in detail and read through dopant profiles to help with CV testing.



## Update 1:

Progress Update:

* Read through chapters 4 and 5 of Modern Semiconductor devices for Integrated circuits&#x20;
* Did research on CV characterization&#x20;
* Wrote the Project Proposal for PMOS including Junction Depth and CV characterization&#x20;
* Completed pattern training with Jay



Roadblocks:&#x20;

* No major roadblocks to report&#x20;



Plans:&#x20;

* Fab a p-type substrate&#x20;
* Look more into the specific experiments we should conduct for CV characterization&#x20;
* Lab next week&#x20;



## Update 0:
