# Haewon Uhm

## Update 1&#x20;

**Accomplishments**&#x20;

* Completed the project proposal and went over it with the TAs&#x20;
* Set up the reflux apparatus in the acid fume hood (SOG)
* Decided to start with replicating the ProjectsInFlight formulation with later tests of catalysts, altering the ratios of ethanol, phosphoric acid, and boric acid (SOG)&#x20;
* Learned in greater detail the systems involved with the ALD controls (ALD)&#x20;

**Challenges**&#x20;

* Still having trouble downloading LabVIEW onto my computer
* Will probably need assistance from Viswesh&#x20;

**Future Plans**&#x20;

* Solidify the plans for SOG and get more acclimated to the lab overall
* Do more research on the chemicals involved, narrowing down the many possibilities of failure (especially the boric acid)&#x20;
* Download LabVIEW and start learning how to use the system&#x20;
* Gain access to the LabVIEW for the ALD&#x20;
