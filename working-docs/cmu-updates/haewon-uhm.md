# Haewon Uhm

## Update 1&#x20;

**Accomplishments**&#x20;

* Completed the project proposal and went over it with the TAs&#x20;
* Set up the reflux apparatus in the acid fume hood (SOG)
* Decided to start with replicating the ProjectsInFlight formulation with later tests of catalysts, altering the ratios of ethanol, phosphoric acid, and boric acid (SOG)&#x20;
* Learned in greater detail the systems involved with the ALD controls (ALD)&#x20;

**Challenges**&#x20;

* Still having trouble downloading LabVIEW onto my computer
* Will probably need assistance from Viswesh&#x20;

**Future Plans**&#x20;

* Solidify the plans for SOG and get more acclimated to the lab overall
* Do more research on the chemicals involved, narrowing down the many possibilities of failure (especially the boric acid)&#x20;
* Download LabVIEW and start learning how to use the system&#x20;
* Gain access to the LabVIEW for the ALD&#x20;



## Update 2 (SOG)&#x20;

**Accomplishments**

* Ordered 95% ethanol that is needed to replicate the ProjectsInFlight formula&#x20;
* To start testing, decided to use isopropyl alcohol as an ethanol replacement
* Looked into the Filmtronics ingredient list for 700B and found it possible to test ratios in the future

**Challenges**

* Realized we did not order ethanol, which is a key ingredient in the ProjectsInFlight video, so I have to wait until that comes in&#x20;
* Already resolved with Jay and Daniel&#x20;

**Future Plans**&#x20;

* Start testing the formulation of the p-doped spin-on glass using TEOS or TMOS, water, isopropyl alcohol, and phosphoric acid (ratios based on the video)&#x20;
* Might not work due to the less polar nature of IPA than ethanol and therefore not provide the emulsification that is needed for the water and TEOS/TMOS



## Update 2 (ALD)

**Accomplishments**

* Got more adapted to LabVIEW and was introduced to the ALD valve and heating element control systems on my computer
* Used a YouTube video to try and connect the MC DAQ to LabVIEW directly

**Challenges**

* Couldn't directly download the LabVIEW file from the GitHub due to the different version that is available for Mac versus Windows&#x20;
* Resolved with Viswesh&#x20;

**Future Plans**&#x20;

* Continue to try and connect the MC DAQ to LabVIEW&#x20;
* If that does not work, make Python code that will alternatively do the job
