### Week 1

This week I wrote a proposal for how I'm going to approach litho software this semester.&#x20;

The proposal is available [here](https://app.gitbook.com/invite/QZ6cJs5t3fpGoMOKzqNM/yN2mWWMV8Xs4tyqCR5eM).

Roadblocks: none, except for the lack of experience that I have in the lab. As I get more familiar with how the software is used in practice, I'll be able to develop quicker and make more informed decisions.

Plans for the week:

* implement automated photo collection when switching to UV mode
  * this will allow us to collect data automatically, which we can use when developing our approach to automatic alignment
* refactor the computer vision code (don't run on every frame), if allows
