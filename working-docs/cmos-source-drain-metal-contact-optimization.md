# CMOS Source/Drain Metal Contact Optimization

## Goals

Develop metal contact formation process (pre, during, and post deposition development) to reduce the contact resistance and Schottky behavior of of metal contacts on Source/Drain regions of PMOS and NMOS devices. Metal type in metal - Si contact is part of optimization.

### Metrics

| Metric                      | Measured Value |
| --------------------------- | -------------- |
| Specific contact resistance | 1E-5 ohm/cm^2  |
| Schottky barrier height     | .7 eV          |
