### The Way we Source Parts

<details>

<summary>Use ChatGPT to Source Parts for You</summary>

* With Bing feature, you ask "source \_\_\_ for me" and add other details:
  * "prioritize parts with low lead times"
  * "inexpensive" or "hobby level"
  * "i liked this one you found, find me more of those"

</details>

<details>

<summary>Find the Part on Amazon</summary>

* Nothing is better than prime shipping
* If you found a part on a manufacturer's website, look up that exact part
* If you cannot find it, try searching for the manufacturer's amazon page
  * They normally have one

</details>

<details>

<summary>Avoid "Contact us for a Quote" at all times</summary>

* We try our best to not support companies that do this. If you ever start a company in the future, put a "buy now" button please.
* Long lead times, wasted time talking to someone, different prices if you are a university, company, individual, they try to package you in with expensive software, etc.

</details>

<details>

<summary>If you don't know which part to buy, use ChatGPT</summary>

* "what else are these parts called? anything else I could use instead"
* "I am trying to find a part that does X, Y, and Z, but I don't know what its called"
* "I am trying to attach \_\_\_ to \_\_\_\_, what can i use?"

</details>

<details>

<summary>As a last resort, you can contact manufacturers</summary>

Some teams, such as Thorlabs, Kurt Lesker, Filmtronics, are very knowledgable and can help bridge the gap of understanding. You can describe to them your situation, send them links of the parts you were considering, and ask them for their advice. Do this sooner rather than later - they take multiple days to respond.
